I can hear you through the walls
I can't escape, no not at all
Random movements, jibber jabber
An erratic jack hammer

Modern day Neanderthal
You make the plaster crack and fall
Soulless living, paint on tan
Red brick estate, let's fumigate

Noise gate
We suffocate
Noise gate
Eyes detonate

Heavy eyelids droop and gaze
Winter's gone with long delays
Growing footsteps, urban sprawl
Sound ignition, waterfall

Is this a dream or ESP?
Toss and turn chaotic sleep
We're the prophets of decay
Suburban life feel the pain

Noise gate
We suffocate
Noise gate
Eyes detonate

Soulless living, paint on tan
Noise gate
Red brick estate, let's fumigate
Noise gate
Suburban life feel the pain
Noise gate
Suburban life we're not the same

Suburbanite
Pseudoparasite

I can hear you through the walls
I can hear you, not at all
