You're playing with my body
Playing with my mind
Playing round the playground
You're flirting with danger
While I'm praying to find some
Playing round the soul playground

Oh no, don't say it
Don't you say a thing
One thing lead to another
I got to get some time to think

I'm crying on your shoulder
You're dying to get out
Flying round the playground
Catch me when I'm falling
Remain in sight and sound
Standing round on plain ground

Oh no, don't say it
Don't you say a thing
One thing lead to another
I got to get some time to think

Keeping it simple, pushing it through
Understanding what she do

Ooh, reasoning
You've got to have something more than just
Ooh, reasoning
You're juggling thoughts until you bust
Ooh, reasoning
You've got to have something more than just
Ooh, ooh, ooh, reasoning
You do it
On the floor

We're swinging, then we're sliding
Seesawing up and down
Flying round the playground
Catch me when I'm falling
Remain in sight and sound
Standing round on plain ground

Oh no, don't say it
Don't you say a thing
One thing lead to another
I got to get some time to think

Keeping it simple, pushing it through
Understanding what she do

Ooh, reasoning
You've got to have something more than just
Ooh, reasoning
You're juggling thoughts until you bust
Ooh, reasoning
You've got to have something more than just
Ooh, ooh, ooh, reasoning
You do it
On the floor

She do it
Playing round
She do it
Playing round
She do it
Playing round
She do it
Playing round
